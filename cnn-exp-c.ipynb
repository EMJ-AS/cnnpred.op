    "CNNPred is code that is based on the paper [CNNPred:CNN-based stock market prediction using several data sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08923.pdf). The code implementents two versions which are CNNPred2 and CNNPred3 which use 2D and 3D input datasets.  The 2D data is time history and features for a particular time series. The 3D data is time history and features for multiple time series.  Both version produce a prediction for a particular time series which could be a market index or the price of an equity.  This is the [blog post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/using-cnn-for-financial-time-series-prediction/) that discusses the implmentation.\n",

    "The following table shows the features used in CNNPred2 and CNNPred3. Note that there is a lot of economic vartiable used from FRED which we could also use. [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org/) is the technical indicators library they use and is one of the more popular ones boasting perhaps the largest number of features. [pandas-ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) is another example and is a newer version that is designed around using pandas.\n"
